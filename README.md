# Comment-analyzer
 This program takes a csv file from the comments on the Snapfood site and by reviewing these comments, it gives a score to the pizza menu of that restaurant out of ten.
To work with the program, your csv file should be such that the first column is the person's name, the second column is the score, the third column is the comment, and the last column is the user's order.
